✌️ My Golang exercise collection

## 1. [fund-valueation-monitor](https://github.com/Colafornia/golang-exercise/tree/master/fund-valueation-monitor)

Perform scheduled task scripts, crawler the net value of the fund on the day, if it is lower than the lowest value of nearly ten trading days, send an email notification

## 2. [urlshort](https://github.com/Colafornia/golang-exercise/tree/master/urlshort)

Create an simple server that will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page, much like URL shortener would.
